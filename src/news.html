<p>Version 2.1 (released xx) contains the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added GLPK solver. You can now solve problems in your browser using the open-source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">GLPK</a> solver, via <a href="https://github.com/hgourvest/glpk.js">glpk.js</a> by Henri Gourvest. This solver runs in the browser on your computer rather than on a cloud server, so is typically much faster than the alternatives.</li>
  <li>Linearity check occurs before solving to catch non-linearities before spending time solving the model.
  <li>Bugfixes:
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug where dialogs could time out before they finished loading.</li>
    <li>Fixed sheet-scoping issue when storing constraints</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
