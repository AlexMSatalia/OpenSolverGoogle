  We found a model from a previous solve that did not finish solving.
  This can happen if the solve exceeds the internal timelimit of Google Sheets,
  or the solve is interrupted for any reason.
</p>

<p>The model was on the sheet: <b><?= getCachedSheetName() ?></b></p>

<p>We saved the progress of this solve, would you like to resume from where it left off?</p>

<section class="button-bar">
  <button class="action" onclick="resume()">Resume Solve</button>
  <button onclick="cancel()">Start New Solve with Selected Model</button>
</section>

<script>
  function resume() {
    dialogDone();
  }

  function cancel() {
    dialogAbort();
  }
</script>
